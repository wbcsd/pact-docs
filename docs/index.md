# PACT Technical Documentation

Welcome to the PACT documentation site. Here you will find technical specifications, conformance tools, and service documentation to support secure, interoperable exchange of product emissions data.



## [PACT Technical Specifications](data-exchange-protocol/)

The PACT Network is an open and global network for the secure peer-to-peer exchange of product emissions data.  
The Technical Specifications describe the PACT data model and exchange API, including:

- **Data Exchange Protocol:** Definitions, API endpoints, and OpenAPI schema for exchanging Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs).
- **Release Plans:** Information about protocol versioning and planned updates.

See the [Technical Specifications](data-exchange-protocol/) for details.



## [PACT Conformance Tool](pact-conformance-service/)

The PACT Conformance Tool is used for assessing conformance of any API implementation to the PACT specifications.  
Resources include:

- **Test Cases:** Documentation and downloadable test case PDFs.
- **Guides:** Step-by-step guides for MVP testing and beta retesting.
- **FAQs:** Frequently asked questions about conformance and testing.

See the [Conformance Tool documentation](pact-conformance-service/) for more.



## [PACT Directory Service](pact-directory-service/)

Identity Management is a foundational service of the PACT Network.  
The Directory Service enables organizations to securely and efficiently identify and establish trust connections with each other at scale, facilitating PCF exchange between solutions.

- **Authentication Flows:** Diagrams and documentation for access and authentication.
- **Design Documents:** Details on authentication-as-a-service and bidirectional flows.
- **FAQs:** Answers to common questions about the directory service.

See the [Directory Service documentation](pact-directory-service/) for more information.
